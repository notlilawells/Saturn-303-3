    "## 5a) The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vinho Verde region of northwest Portugal brings affordable wines of diverse flavor profiles and complexities to everyday individuals [1]. As this region continues to gain influence and grow as a wine exporter, it is crucial that wineyard and consumers proportionally scale their ability to determine the quality of each wine variant (a key metric in identifying a wine's price and how it will sell). Quality is an important metric used in a wineâ€™s certification process in the market. A wine's quality helps vintners determine how to properly price a wine, as well as how to market it [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, wine quality is (at least at the moment) largely determined by sommeliers [2]. Though these individuals are experts in wine-tasting, sommeliers too are humans with subjective opinions and personal preferences in taste. Therefore, the industry has begun to support the *sommelier-determined measure* of quality through the measurement of objective physicochemical properties of wines, such as pH and alcohol values. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to expand this practice, **we will build a model that predicts sommelier-determined wine quality based on physicochemical properties of Vinho Verde wines.** Given the great diversity in climate, grapes, and methods of winemaking in the Vinho Verde region and wine-production areas [1], this model would likely be generalizable when predicting the qualities of wines from other regions (especially those surrounding Vinho Verde)."

    "\n",
    "To assess the accuracy of our regression model, we plan to optimize its **RMSE**. We want to understand and accurately predict the quality of *each individual wine sample* from our dataset. Thus, we would like the error of each individual prediction to be minimized, and for our performance metric to be particularly sensitive to larger errors. RMSE accomplishes this by penalizing larger errors more than smaller ones. MAE would be useful if we were not as interested in having a performance metric that was sensitive to larger errors, or or if we were indifferent as to how the error is distributed across wine samples. However, that is not our focus in this project - and thus we choose to optimize the model's RMSE. "

By implementing ensemble modeling and leveraging different modeling methods, we are confident that our model will outperform existing Kaggle solutions."
