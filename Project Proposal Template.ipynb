    "## 5a) The problem\n",
    "The Vinho Verde region of northwest Portugal brings affordable wines of diverse flavor profiles and complexities to everyday individuals [1]. As this region grows as a wine exporter, it is crucial that wineyards scale up their ability to determine the quality of each wine. Quality is an important metric used in the wineâ€™s certification process to the market and helps vinters determine the properly price their wines [2]. Currently, however, wine quality is largely determined by sommeliers [2]. Though these individuals are experts in wine-tasting, sommeliers too are humans with subjective opinions and personal preferences in taste. Therefore, the industry has begun to support the sommelier-determined measure of quality through the measurement of objective physicochemical properties of the wines, such as pH and alcohol values. In effort to expand this practice, we will build a model that predicts sommelier-determined wine quality based on physicochemical properties of Vinho Verde wines. Given the great diversity in climate, grapes, and methods of winemaking in the Vinho Verde wines [1], this model would likely be generalizable to determination of quality for wines from other regions.\n",

    "To assess the accuracy of our regression model, we will optimize RMSE. We want to understand the quality of each individual wine sample, and thus would like the error for each individual prediction to be minimized. RMSE accomplishes this by penalizing large errors. MAE would be useful if we wanted the overall error across the wine samples to be low, and are indifferent to how the error is distributed across the wine samples."

By implementing ensemble modeling and leveraging different modeling methods, we are confident that our model will outperform existing Kaggle solutions."
