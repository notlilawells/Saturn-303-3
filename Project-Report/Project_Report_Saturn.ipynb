    "## Background / Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vinho Verde region of northwest Portugal brings affordable wines of diverse flavor profiles and complexities to everyday individuals [1]. As this region continues to gain influence and grow as a wine exporter, it is crucial that wineyard and consumers proportionally scale their ability to determine the quality of each wine variant (a key metric in identifying a wine's price and how it will sell). Quality is an important metric used in a wine’s certification process in the market. A wine's quality helps vintners determine how to properly price a wine, as well as how to market it [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, wine quality is (at least at the moment) largely determined by sommeliers [2]. Though these individuals are experts in wine-tasting, sommeliers too are humans with subjective opinions and personal preferences in taste. Therefore, the industry has begun to support the sommelier-determined measure of quality through the measurement of objective physicochemical properties of wines, such as pH and alcohol values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to expand this practice, we built a series of models to predict sommelier-determined wine quality based on physicochemical properties of Vinho Verde wines. We were motivated to approach this topic in particular as all of our group members are bourgeoning young-adults of drinking age. Thus, we hoped to better learn about and understand wine practices through our project so that we may better approach our interactions with wine in the future. We are also all interested in the world of sommeliers and oenologists, and hope to  explore their practices and quality measurements through our research and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the great diversity in climate, grapes, and methods of winemaking in the Vinho Verde region and wine-production areas [1], this model would likely be generalizable when predicting the qualities of wines from other regions (especially those surrounding Vinho Verde). "

    "## Problem statement \n",
    "\n",
    "To approach our analysis, we first articulated our objective: to predict oenologist-determined wine qualities of Vinho Verde wines (on a 1 to 10 scale) using the physical and chemical attributes of those wines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our objective involves predicting a response variable that has integer values from 1 to 10, we elected to approach this problem with regression (i.e., predicting the response on a continuous scale and rounding our predictions to integer values thereafter) instead of multi-classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to approach this problem with regression because our response values (from 1 to 10) have an inherent order (as ordinal values), and the magnitude of the difference between consecutive values is meaningful. For example, the difference between \"1\" and \"2\" quality wines may be similar to the diffference between quality \"9\" and \"10\" wines. Regression helps to capture this relationship by considering the magnitude of the values. \n"

    "## Data sources\n",
    "What data did you use? Provide details about your data. Include links to data if you are using open-access data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We elected to use data set entitled \"Wine Quality Data Set\" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). This dataset helped us to address our project by comprehensively cataloging the different qualities of over 6,000 red and white variants of Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine from 2004 to 2007. A wine's quality is based on its physicochemical properties, and this data set included 10 of such properties - thus reinforcing its use in our goal to predict wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our response variable here was wine quality, represented by the variable quality in this dataset. This value ranged from 1 to 10. The predictors we used included physicochemical attributes of wine such as pH, density, fixed and volatile acidity, citric acid content, residual sugars, chlorides, free sulfur dioxides and total sulfur dioxides, sulphates, alcohol quality, and wine type (red or white). There are 11 total predictors in the dataset: 10 continuous predictors one categorical predictor. There are 6,497 total observations in this dataset, and each observation erepresents a different wine sample."

    "## Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project addresses the interests of three stakeholder groups: (1) wine producers, (2) restaurants and bars, and (3) oenologists and sommeliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wine producers** have a vested interest in predicting a wine's quality, as often quality equates to both a wine's performance in the market and its return on investment, or ROI. Higher quality wines are typically expensive. They thus yield a higher ROI than lower quality wines - and this direclty impacts wine producers. Wine producers invest copious amounts of time and money into cultivating different wine variants. Thus, our project benefits these stakeholders by offering them a measure to predict a wine's quality with accuracy and reliability - information that they may then use to either gauge a wine's performance in the market or to choose how to best spend their time and money (perhaps on wines that are will be more expensive and will thus financially benefit them more).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant and bar owners** who buy wine for their businesses may also be interested in assessing a wine’s quality. These stakeholders often buy wine from vineyards to sell in their businesses. They buy different wine variants with the goal of later selling them to customers for an upcharge. These stakeholders need to know the quality of the wines they are buying, as this metric informs how much restaurants and bars can charge for a given glass. Thus, our model may allow these stakeholders to assess the quality of the wines that they are considering for their establishments. By developing a model to predict a wine's quality, our project allows these stakeholders to not only assess a wine's quality overall (and thus figure out how to best market and charge for that wine), but also explore the range of wines to include (as, typically, restaurants include a variety of wine types and qualities - a \"good mix\" is encouraged to cater to diverse customer wants and needs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our third and final stakeholders include **oenologists and sommeliers**. Oenologists and sommeliers are currently working to establish defined measures for determining a wine's quality by evaluating its physiochemical characteristics. By incorporating these characteristics as predictors in our modeling processes, our project may offer these stakeholders a method to more easily and accurately determine a wine's quality through its make up - without having to spend exhaustive hours comparing one wine's composition to another's. This project offers a tool that, if accurate and reliable, could be leveraged by oenologists and sommeliers to better gauge the performance and quality of their industry's product."
